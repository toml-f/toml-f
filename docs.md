A TOML parser implementation for data serialization and deserialization in Fortran.

* the [TOML standard](https://toml.io)
* currently supported [TOML v1.0.0-rc3 specification](https://toml.io/en/v1.0.0-rc.3)
* the [TOML-Fortran project](https://github.com/toml-f/toml-f)


## Getting Started
[![template](https://img.shields.io/badge/template-meson-success)](https://github.com/toml-f/tf-meson-example)
[![template](https://img.shields.io/badge/template-cmake-success)](https://github.com/toml-f/tf-cmake-example)

### Meson

Create a new meson project and include `toml-f` either as git-submodule in your subprojects directory or create a wrap file to fetch it from upstream:

```ini
[wrap-git]
directory = toml-f
url = https://github.com/toml-f/toml-f
revision = head
```

To load the project the necessary boilerplate code for subprojects is just

<!--pygments doesn't know about meson, python highlighting looks okayish-->
```python
tomlf_prj = subproject(
  'toml-f',
  version: '>=0.2',
  default_options: [
    'default_library=static',
  ],
)
tomlf_dep = tomlf_prj.get_variable('tomlf_dep')
```

Now you can add `tomlf_dep` to your dependencies and access the public API by the `tomlf` module.

We recommend to set the default library type of `toml-f` to static when linking your applications or library against it.
Note for library type both and shared `toml-f` will install itself along with your project.

For more fine-tuned control you can access:

- the library target with `tomlf_lib`
- the private include dir of this target, containing the Fortran module files, with `tomlf_inc`
- the license files of `toml-f` with `tomlf_lic`

If you are linking your application statically against `toml-f` and still want to distribute the license files of `toml-f` (thank you), just use

```python
install_data(
  tomlf_prj.get_variable('tomlf_lic'),
  install_dir: get_option('datadir')/'licenses'/meson.project_name()/'toml-f',
)
```


### CMake

Create a new CMake project and include `toml-f` as git-submodule in your subprojects directory with

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/toml-f/toml-f subprojects/toml-f
```

To include the project the necessary boilerplate code for subprojects is just

```cmake
# subprojects/CMakeLists.txt
set(BUILD_SHARED_LIBS OFF)
add_subdirectory("toml-f")
list(
  APPEND lib-deps
  "toml-f-lib"
)
set(lib-deps "${lib-deps}" PARENT_SCOPE)
```

Now you can add `toml-f-lib` to your dependencies and access the public API by the `tomlf` module.

We recommend to disable building `toml-f` as shared library and just link your applications or library statically against it.
The `toml-f` subproject will decide based on the library type if it should install itself along with your project.


### Fortran Package Manager (fpm)

TOML-Fortran supports [fpm](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm) as build system as well.
Just add `toml-f` to the dependencies in your `fpm.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
[dependencies.toml-f]
git = "https://github.com/toml-f/toml-f"
```

For a usage example of `toml-f` you can look-up the example in the TOML-Fortran repository ([example-1](https://github.com/toml-f/toml-f/tree/master/test/example-1)) or just checkout [fpm](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm) itself, which is using `toml-f`.
